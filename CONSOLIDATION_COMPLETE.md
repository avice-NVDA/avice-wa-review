## What Was Done

### Phase 1: Enhanced architecture.mdc ✅

**Added 3 New Sections** (Lines 137-165, 635-705):

1. **Histogram and Multi-Table Output** (Lines 137-143)
   - Philosophy: Terminal shows Table 2 only, HTML shows all tables
   - 70% console output reduction while maintaining HTML completeness

2. **Runtime Display Standards** (Lines 145-165)
   - Color-coded runtime values (Green <2h, Yellow 2-5h, Red >5h)
   - Stage highlighting rules
   - Timestamp display requirements

3. **Master Dashboard Standards** (Lines 635-705)
   - Unified dashboard requirements
   - Section card format and status logic
   - Visual features and interactive elements
   - File naming conventions
   - Integration with section HTMLs
