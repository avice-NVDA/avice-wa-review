# Avice Workarea Review Project - Architecture Rules
# This file contains all coding standards, patterns, and rules for the workarea review project
# Based on .cursorrules and project-specific patterns established during development

# Project Context and Communication
# When this file is part of the AI assistant's context, the assistant should:
# 1. Address the user as "Sir avice" in all responses (OVERRIDES global "Mr avice" rule)
# 2. Reference this architecture file when making decisions
# 3. Confirm adherence to these rules when implementing features
# 4. Use "Sir avice" as a signal that the project-specific architecture rules are active
# 5. Project-specific rules in this file take precedence over global Python standards

# Unix Shell Compatibility Rules

When writing code that outputs to Unix shells or terminals, always use ASCII characters instead of Unicode symbols to ensure proper display across all terminal environments.

## Character Substitutions for Console Output

| Unicode Symbol | ASCII Replacement | Usage Example |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| `→` (arrow) | `->` | Show progression/change: "10 -> 20" |
| `✓` (checkmark) | `[OK]` | Success indicators: "[OK] Complete" |
| `✗` (X mark) | `[ERROR]` | Error indicators: "[ERROR] Failed" |
| `⚠` (warning) | `[WARN]` | Warning indicators: "[WARN] Check required" |
| `•` (bullet) | `-` | List items: "- Item 1" |
| `▶` (triangle right) | `>` | HTML only (safe in web content) |
| `▼` (triangle down) | `v` | HTML only (safe in web content) |

## Console Output Rules

**Bad:** `print(f"Status: ✓ Complete")` - Unicode breaks in Unix shells  
**Good:** `print(f"Status: [OK] Complete")` - ASCII works everywhere

**Safe Unicode Usage:** HTML content, Markdown docs, comments/docstrings only  
**Testing:** Always test console output in actual Unix shells before committing

# File Path and System Compatibility

1. Use absolute paths when possible for reliability
2. Handle both relative and absolute paths gracefully
3. Use os.path.join() for path construction
4. Check file existence before operations
5. Handle gzipped files (.gz) appropriately
6. Use proper encoding (utf-8) for file operations
7. **CRITICAL: Always filter out symlinks when searching directories to avoid duplicates**
   - Common issue: `umake_log/latest_dir` is a symlink to the most recent log directory
   - Problem: Without filtering, the same log appears twice (once via symlink, once via real path)
   - Solution: Use `os.path.realpath()` to resolve symlinks, then track processed real paths in a set
   - Example affected patterns: `umake_log/*/*.log`, `signoff_flow/*/work_*`, etc.
   - Always check if a path is a symlink before processing multiple file results

# Error Handling Best Practices

1. Use try-except blocks for file operations
2. Provide informative error messages
3. Log errors with context (file path, operation)
4. Handle common exceptions: OSError, UnicodeDecodeError, FileNotFoundError
5. Use specific exception types when possible
6. Include fallback mechanisms for critical operations

# Code Style and Structure

1. Use descriptive variable and function names
2. Add docstrings to all functions and classes
3. Use type hints where appropriate
4. Keep functions focused on single responsibilities
5. Use meaningful comments for complex logic
6. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
7. **ALWAYS update documentation when making code changes**:
   - Update main docstring when changing CLI arguments or behavior
   - Update help text (epilog) to reflect new features or options
   - Update function/class docstrings when changing signatures or behavior
   - Update examples to demonstrate new functionality
   - Keep README files synchronized with actual behavior

# Output Formatting Standards

1. CRITICAL: Minimize Console Output Lines
   - Every new line printed to Unix shell makes the review longer and harder to read
   - Combine related metrics into single lines whenever possible
   - Use separators like "|" or "," to group information compactly
   - Examples:
     * Design Area + Die Dimensions in ONE line
     * DSR Skew trends for multiple work areas in ONE line
     * Timing path groups as comma-separated list in ONE line
   - HTML reports can have unlimited detail and lines - be verbose there
   - Console output should be concise, scannable, and actionable

2. ALWAYS use table formatting for structured data with multiple parameters:
   - When displaying multiple rows of data with similar columns
   - When showing numbers, counts, or metrics in a structured way
   - When presenting parameters, errors, or status information
   - Tables make data much easier to read and scan

3. Table formatting guidelines:
   - Use proper column alignment (left for text, right for numbers)
   - Include clear headers with appropriate spacing
   - Truncate long descriptions with "..." if needed
   - Use consistent column widths for readability
   - Add separators (dashes) between header and data rows

4. Examples of when to use tables:
   - GL Check results (Checker Name, Count, Error ID, Description)
   - Runtime summaries (Stage, Category, Runtime, Start, End)
   - Error listings (Error Type, Count, Description)
   - Parameter comparisons (Parameter, Value, Status)
   - Any structured data with 3+ columns of information

5. **Histogram and Multi-Table Output**:
   - For timing histograms with 3+ tables, print only the most useful table to terminal
   - Table 2 (Sub-Category Breakdown) provides best balance of detail vs. brevity
   - Extract all tables for HTML reports (unlimited detail allowed)
   - Example: PnR timing histograms - Terminal shows Table 2, HTML shows all 3 tables
   - Reduces console output by ~70% while maintaining HTML completeness
   - Philosophy: Terminal = scannable summary, HTML = comprehensive deep-dive

## Runtime Display Standards

1. **Color-Coded Runtime Values** (for HTML reports):
   - Green: < 2 hours (excellent performance)
   - Yellow: 2-5 hours (acceptable)
   - Red: > 5 hours (needs optimization)
   - Apply to both individual stages and total runtime
   
2. **Stage Highlighting**:
   - Highlight maximum runtime stage in bold/colored background
   - Show percentage of total runtime for context
   - Help identify bottlenecks quickly in visual reports
   - Example: "postroute: 3.5h (45% of total)" in bold/red
   
3. **Timestamp Display Requirements**:
   - Always show start/end timestamps for all stages (format: MM/DD HH:MM)
   - Calculate elapsed time accurately (hours:minutes:seconds)
   - Detect RUNNING flows: show "RUNNING" status with elapsed time from start
   - For completed stages: show full timeline (start → end → duration)
   - Annotate inferred completion times when using output file timestamps

# Performance Considerations

1. Use generators for large data processing
2. Avoid reading entire files into memory when possible
3. Use efficient data structures (sets for lookups, etc.)
4. Cache frequently accessed data
5. Use appropriate data types for the task
6. Profile code for bottlenecks

# Security and Safety

1. Validate input paths to prevent directory traversal
2. Sanitize user input before file operations
3. Use subprocess safely (avoid shell=True when possible)
4. Handle sensitive data appropriately
5. Log security-relevant events
6. Use proper file permissions

# ASIC/SoC Development Specific

1. Handle large log files efficiently
2. Parse timing reports with robust regex patterns
3. Generate HTML reports for complex data visualization
4. Use appropriate data structures for design metrics
5. Handle missing or incomplete data gracefully
6. Provide clear progress indicators for long operations

# Flow Status Detection and Timeline Analysis

1. Flow completion should be determined by both:
   - Presence/absence of STEP__END__* marker files
   - Existence of expected output files (primary indicators)

2. Star (Parasitic Extraction) flow status:
   - Check for SPEF files (*.spef.typical_T0.gz) as primary completion indicator
   - If SPEF exists but STEP__END is missing, mark as completed with annotation
   - Use "(inferred from output files)" annotation in yellow when END marker is missing
   - This handles cases where flows complete but don't write END markers properly

3. PT (PrimeTime) flow status:
   - Check for timing reports and HTML outputs
   - Validate completion based on report file timestamps

4. General flow timeline rules:
   - Always show start/end timestamps from STEP__BEGIN__* and STEP__END__* files
   - Calculate durations accurately (hours, minutes, seconds)
   - Mark flows as RUNNING only when: BEGIN exists, END missing, AND output files don't exist
   - Annotate inferred completion times when using output file timestamps

# Documentation and Branding Standards

1. ALWAYS use the Alon Vice ASCII art logo in script headers:
   ```
   #===============================================================================
   #      +===+ +--+ +--+ +=+ +===+ +===+
   #      |   | |  | |  | | | |     |    
   #      |===| |  +-+  | | | |     |=== 
   #      |   |  |     |  | | |     |    
   #      |   |   +---+   +=+ +===+ +===+                                 
   #            ~ Alon Vice Tools ~

   # All rights reserved.
   # This script is the intellectual property of Alon Vice.
   # For permissions and licensing, contact: avice@nvidia.com
   #===============================================================================
   ```

2. Include comprehensive header documentation with:
   - Script name and purpose
   - Detailed description
   - Usage syntax with examples
   - Arguments explanation
   - Prerequisites
   - Output description
   - Examples section

3. Use consistent formatting:
   - 80-character width separators (#===============================================================================)
   - Proper indentation for multi-line descriptions
   - Clear section headers
   - Contact information: avice@nvidia.com

4. When generating new scripts or adding headers, always include:
   - The ASCII art logo
   - Copyright notice
   - Intellectual property statement
   - Contact information
   - Comprehensive documentation following the established pattern

# Workarea Management Standards

1. **ALWAYS use AGUR_UNITS_TABLE.csv as the authoritative source for test workareas**:
   - Location: `agur_release_tracking/AGUR_UNITS_TABLE.csv`
   - Contains 72 units across 7 chiplets (auto-updated daily from central block release)
   - Each unit has validated workarea path, chiplet assignment, RTL tag, and release metadata
   - NO manual maintenance required - automatically synchronized with production releases
   - Use these workareas when testing new code changes
   - Different workareas reveal different outputs and edge cases

2. **Testing methodology using AGUR database**:
   - **Single unit testing**: Use `-u <unit_name>` flag with avice_wa_review.py
   - **Multi-unit testing**: Use `batch_review.py` with filters for targeted testing
   - **Quick testing**: Use `--random --limit 5` for varied sampling
   - **Chiplet-specific testing**: Use `--chiplet <CHIPLET_NAME>` filter
   - **Targeted testing**: Use `--units <unit1> <unit2> ...` for specific units

3. Testing workflow examples:
   ```bash
   # Test specific units (interactive)
   python3 avice_wa_review.py -u prt
   python3 avice_wa_review.py -u ccorea -s formal
   
   # Batch test multiple units (automated)
   python3 batch_review.py --units prt ccorea fdb
   python3 batch_review.py --chiplet CPORT
   python3 batch_review.py --random --limit 5
   python3 batch_review.py  # Full regression (all 72 units)
   ```

4. Testing efficiency:
   - When testing 2+ units, ALWAYS use `batch_review.py` (single approval, organized results)
   - When testing 1 unit, use `avice_wa_review.py -u <unit>` (direct feedback)
   - Use filters (`--units`, `--chiplet`, `--random`, `--limit`) for targeted testing
   - Batch test commands provide structured results in `batch_review_results/`
   - Report results for all tested workareas in a single summary

# Cross-Directory Execution Standards

1. CRITICAL SECURITY: NEVER write files to storage that doesn't belong to the user
   - Always generate HTML reports in the current working directory, not the target workarea
   - Users may not have write permissions to other users' storage directories
   - This prevents permission errors and security violations

2. **Path handling principles**:
   - Generate reports in the script's current directory, not the analyzed workarea
   - **Use absolute paths in HTML content to ensure links work from any location**
   - Test scripts from multiple different directories to verify functionality
   - Remember: relative paths are relative to where the script is run, not where the HTML is generated
   - **See "HTML Report Portability" section for detailed requirements on absolute paths**

3. Testing cross-directory execution:
   - Always test running scripts from different directories
   - Verify that generated HTML reports have working links
   - Test both relative and absolute path scenarios
   - Document any path-related issues found during testing
   - **Test HTML portability**: Copy HTML to different locations and verify all links work

4. **HTML Report Organization - REQUIRED for Development/Testing**:
   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT change the HTML generation paths in the code (they should remain in current working directory)
   - **REQUIRED AFTER TESTING**: Move all generated HTML files to `html/` directory for organization
   - Location: `/home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review/html/`
   - This keeps test artifacts organized without changing user-facing behavior
   - **Why this matters**:
     * Users generate HTML reports in their own working directories (correct behavior)
     * Developers testing in the project directory create HTML files that clutter the repository
     * The `html/` folder is gitignored and keeps the project directory clean
   - **Procedure after each testing session**:
     ```bash
     cd /home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review
     mv *.html html/  # Move all HTML files to html folder
     ```
   - **DO THIS EVERY TIME** you finish testing to keep the project organized

# Workarea Review Project Specific Rules

## HTML/CSS Rendering Compatibility

**Environment:** Firefox 118.0.1 (recommended) at `/home/utils/firefox-118.0.1/firefox`

**CSS Support:**
- ✅ Flexbox: Use for simple responsive layouts, summary cards
- ✅ CSS Grid: Use for complex 2D layouts, dashboards, table structures
- ✅ Transitions, animations, media queries, transforms, shadows, gradients

**Testing:** Always test layouts in Firefox 118+ or modern browsers

## HTML Report Standards

1. **CRITICAL: HTML/Terminal Output Synchronization**
   - **ALWAYS update HTML reports when terminal output changes**
   - HTML reports must contain ALL data displayed in terminal output AND MORE
   - Terminal output = high-level summary for quick review
   - HTML output = comprehensive deep-dive with extra functionalities
   - When adding new features to terminal output, IMMEDIATELY update corresponding HTML generation
   - HTML should include: timestamps, detailed tables, interactive elements, filterable data, downloadable links
   - Never let HTML reports become stale or missing recent feature additions
   - Examples of HTML-exclusive features:
     * Start/End timestamps for all stages
     * Clickable log file links
     * Highlighted max runtime stages
     * Expandable/collapsible sections
     * Detailed breakdown tables
     * Flow timeline visualizations
     * Fast DC detection indicators
     * RTL stage indicators

2. **CRITICAL: Copyright Footer - ALWAYS Include in ALL HTML Reports**
   - Every HTML report MUST include professional copyright footer before `</body>`
   - Format: `<div class="footer">` with gradient background (blue), green highlights
   - Include: Report name, "Copyright (c) 2025 Alon Vice (avice)", "Contact: avice@nvidia.com"
   - Reference existing reports for CSS/HTML code (gradient styling, centered, rounded corners)

2.5. **CRITICAL: Back to Top Button - ALWAYS Include in ALL HTML Reports**
   - Floating "↑ Top" button: Fixed bottom-right (30px), appears after 300px scroll
   - Style: Purple theme (#667eea), hover scale effect, smooth scroll behavior
   - Requires: Button HTML + JavaScript for scroll detection and click handler
   - Reference existing reports for full implementation code

3. ALWAYS generate HTML reports with timestamps in filenames:
   - Format: `{USER}_[report_type]_[design]_[ipo]_{timestamp}.html`
   - Example: `avice_pnr_data_fth_ipo1000_20250930_150418.html`
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER hardcode "avice" in HTML filenames - always use `os.environ.get('USER', 'avice')`
   
4. **HTML Filename Username Handling**:
   ```python
   # ✅ CORRECT - Use environment variable for username
   html_filename = f"{os.environ.get('USER', 'avice')}_runtime_report_{design}_{timestamp}.html"
   html_filename = f"{os.environ.get('USER', 'avice')}_MASTER_dashboard_{design}_{date}.html"
   html_filename = f"{os.environ.get('USER', 'avice')}_DC_comprehensive_{design}_{timestamp}.html"
   
   # ❌ WRONG - Hardcoded username breaks cross-user usage
   html_filename = f"avice_runtime_report_{design}_{timestamp}.html"
   ```
   
   **Why this matters**:
   - Reports generated by different users should have their username in filename
   - Master dashboard links to section HTMLs must use relative paths (just filename)
   - When user "brachas" generates reports, files should be named "brachas_*", not "avice_*"
   - Enables multiple users to generate reports in shared directories without conflicts
   - The 'avice' fallback is only used if $USER environment variable is not set

5. HTML report features:
   - Professional CSS styling with gradients and modern design
   - Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
   - Clickable links to log files and reports
   - Table formatting for structured data
   - Color-coded status indicators
   - Alon Vice branding and logo
   - Interactive elements (modals, tooltips, expandable sections)
   - Comprehensive data beyond what's shown in terminal

6. HTML report types:
   - Runtime Report: `avice_runtime_report_[design]_{timestamp}.html`
   - PnR Data Report: `avice_pnr_data_[design]_[ipo]_{timestamp}.html`
   - Image Debug Report: `avice_image_debug_report_[design]_{timestamp}.html`
   - Documentation Manual: `avice_wa_review_manual_{timestamp}.html`

7. Log file viewing integration:
   - All log file links in HTML reports use the custom tablog viewer: `/home/scratch.avice_vlsi/tablog/tablog`
   - Clicking "View in tablog" button copies the tablog command to clipboard
   - Users can paste the command in their terminal to open logs with tablog
   - Alternative raw file link (📄) provided for direct file access
   - Toast notifications confirm successful copy to clipboard

8. **CRITICAL: HTML Report Portability - Absolute Paths Required**
   - **ALWAYS use absolute paths for ALL file links in HTML reports**
   - HTML reports must work from any location where users open them
   - Users frequently copy HTML files to their home directories, shared locations, or different mount points
   - Relative paths break when HTML is opened from a different directory than where it was generated
   
   **Path Conversion Requirements**:
   ```python
   # ✅ CORRECT - Convert to absolute path before storing for HTML
   filepath = os.path.abspath(filepath)
   html_reports.append(os.path.abspath(html_file))
   key_reports.append((name, os.path.abspath(filepath)))
   
   # ✅ CORRECT - Handle paths from external files (e.g., prc.status)
   abs_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(self.workarea, path)) if not os.path.isabs(path) else path
   
   # ❌ WRONG - Relative paths break portability
   html_reports.append(html_file)  # Could be relative!
   ```
   
   **HTML Link Format**:
   ```html
   <!-- ✅ CORRECT - Absolute path works from anywhere -->
   <a href="file:///home/scratch.user/workarea/signoff_flow/auto_pt/work_08.10.25_19:02.html">
       work_08.10.25_19:02.html
   </a>
   
   <!-- ❌ WRONG - Relative path breaks when HTML opened from different location -->
   <a href="file://auto_pt/work_08.10.25_19:02.html">work_08.10.25_19:02.html</a>
   ```
   
   **Files That Must Use Absolute Paths**:
   - Work directory HTML files (PT timing summary)
   - Log files (GL Check, Runtime, etc.)
   - Report files (ClockTree.rpt, cellStats.rpt, etc.)
   - Error files (gl-check.all.waived, gl-check.all.err)
   - Status files (prc.status)
   - Any file referenced via `file://` URL in HTML
   
   **Testing Protocol**:
   - Generate HTML report in workarea directory
   - Copy HTML to user home directory
   - Open HTML and verify all links work
   - Test from different mount points
   - Verify all `file://` URLs open correctly
   
   **Impact**: HTML reports are truly portable and work from any location for all users

## Master Dashboard Standards

1. **Unified Dashboard Requirements**:
   - Single-page overview integrating all workarea analysis sections
   - Expandable/collapsible section cards with status badges
   - Smart defaults: FAIL/WARN sections expanded, PASS sections collapsed by default
   - Overall health aggregation from all section statuses
   - Quick navigation with attention-required section highlighting problem areas
   - Generated in current working directory (like all HTML reports)
   
2. **Section Card Format**:
   - Index number corresponding to analysis flow (matches terminal output)
   - Status badge (PASS/WARN/FAIL/NOT_RUN) with color coding
   - Key metrics display (2-3 most important values per section)
   - Issues list (up to 3 critical items shown in card)
   - Timestamp of analysis
   - "View Details" button linking to detailed HTML report (absolute path)
   
3. **Status Logic Standards**:
   - **PASS** (Green #27ae60): Section completed successfully, no issues detected
   - **WARN** (Orange #f39c12): Attention recommended, non-critical issues found
   - **FAIL** (Red #e74c3c): Critical issues found requiring immediate action
   - **NOT_RUN** (Gray #95a5a6): Section not executed or no data available
   
4. **Intelligent Section Status Rules**:
   - **Setup**: Always PASS (basic info extraction)
   - **Runtime**: Always PASS (informational only)
   - **Synthesis**: Always PASS (basic compilation)
   - **PnR**: FAIL if utilization >95%, WARN if >85% or timing violations
   - **Clock**: FAIL if max latency >=580ps, WARN if >550ps
   - **Formal**: FAIL if any flow FAILED, WARN if UNRESOLVED/RUNNING
   - **Star**: FAIL if shorts >0, WARN if SPEF files <6 (missing corners)
   - **PT**: FAIL if WNS <-0.050ns or TNS <-10.0ns, WARN if WNS <0 or TNS <0
   - **PV**: FAIL if LVS >5 or DRC >100 or Antenna >10, WARN if any violations >0
   - **GL Check**: FAIL if non-waived >=50, WARN if non-waived >0
   - **ECO**: Basic summary, shows PT-ECO loop count
   - **NV Gate ECO**: Basic summary, shows design info
   - **Block Release**: Basic summary, shows design info
   
5. **Dashboard Visual Features**:
   - Purple gradient header matching PT report styling
   - Responsive grid layout (3 columns desktop → 1 column mobile)
   - Smooth hover effects and transitions
   - Professional shadows and rounded corners
   - Embedded base64 logo for portability
   - Back-to-top button for long dashboards
   - Copyright footer with contact info
   
6. **Dashboard Interactive Elements**:
   - Click card header to expand/collapse
   - Rotating arrow icon (▼/▶) shows expand state
   - Quick action buttons:
     * "Open All Failed/Warning Sections" - batch open problem areas
     * "Open All Sections" - open all detail reports
     * "Print Dashboard" - print-friendly format
   - Search functionality (future enhancement)
   - Filter by status (future enhancement)
   
7. **Dashboard File Naming**:
   - Format: `{USER}_MASTER_dashboard_{design}_{date}.html`
   - Example: `avice_MASTER_dashboard_prt_20251017.html`
   - Date format: YYYYMMDD (no time component for daily uniqueness)
   - Always use $USER environment variable for username
   
8. **Integration with Section HTMLs**:
   - Master dashboard links to detailed section HTML reports
   - Links use relative paths (just filename) since all HTMLs in same directory
   - Each section HTML has absolute paths for its internal file links
   - Master dashboard shows summary, section HTMLs show comprehensive detail
   - Maintain separation: Dashboard = overview, Section HTMLs = deep-dive

## Command Line Interface Standards

1. ALWAYS use absolute paths in help text and examples:
   - Use `/home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review_launcher.csh` for all examples
   - Never use relative paths like `./avice_wa_review.py`
   - Recommend the C-shell launcher over direct Python calls

2. Documentation generation options:
   - `--help-docs`: Display formatted documentation in terminal
   - `--open-docs`: Generate HTML documentation and open in browser
   - `--generate-pdf`: Generate PDF documentation
   - `--docs-section`: Choose specific section (usage, examples, troubleshooting, organization, all)

3. Section names for selective analysis:
   - setup, runtime, recipe, synthesis, pnr, clock, formal, parasitic, timing, pv, gl-check, eco, nv-gate-eco, block-release

## Data Extraction Patterns

1. PT (PrimeTime) Signoff Timing Analysis:
   - **Dual-Scenario Analysis**: Extract both Setup and Hold scenarios
   - **Dynamic Corner Discovery**: Automatically discovers ALL available setup/hold corners in work directory
   - **Worst-Case Selection**: Selects scenario with most negative TNS (worst timing) from all discovered corners
   - **CRITICAL: Scenario-Specific Values**:
     * **Timing values (WNS/TNS/NVP) WILL differ between scenarios** - different corners produce different results
     * **DSR skew values WILL differ between scenarios** - corner-dependent (e.g., setup: 11ps, hold: 0.45ps)
     * Each scenario has its own DSR skew file with corner-specific values
     * NEVER assume setup and hold have the same values - always extract from both
   - **Internal vs External Timing Groups**:
     * Internal groups: All timing groups except FEEDTHROUGH/REGIN/REGOUT
     * External groups (FEEDTHROUGH/REGIN/REGOUT): Relaxed during PT, always 0
     * Display internal timing sum separately (WNS/TNS/NVP)
     * In HTML tables, show external groups at the END (less interesting)
   - **DSR Mux Clock Skew Tracking**:
     * Extract from BOTH setup and hold scenario files separately
     * Each scenario has its own file: [scenario]/reports/timing_reports/*.dsr_mux_clock_skew
     * Color thresholds: Green (<=10ps excellent), Yellow/Red (>10ps unacceptable)
     * Show separate trends for setup and hold scenarios
     * Track across all work directories
   - **PT Runtime**: Extract from "Elapsed time for this session" in work_dir/*.log
   - **HTML Report Features**:
     * Separate tables for Setup and Hold scenarios
     * DSR skew column shows scenario-specific values
     * Total Internal column shows sum of internal timing groups per scenario
     * Column order: DSR Skew -> Total Internal -> Internal groups (by TNS) -> External groups
     * **Internal groups sorted by worst TNS** (most negative first) - makes critical groups immediately visible
     * External groups sorted alphabetically at the end
     * Clickable links to PT HTML reports
     * Color-coded timing violations

2. ECO/Signoff Workarea Detection:
   - **Workarea Type**: Workarea created by copying PnR database from another user/location
   - **Methodology**: Enables incremental changes without full re-synthesis/re-PnR
   - **Directory Structure**:
     * ✅ Has: `export/export_innovus/` (contains imported PnR results: DEF, netlists, LEF, GDS/OAS)
     * ✅ Has: `signoff_flow/` (ECO work: nv_gate_eco, auto_pt, gl-check, formal verification)
     * ✅ Has: `syn_flow/` (synthesis outputs)
     * ✅ Has: `sources/` (design sources)
     * ✅ Has: `pnr_flow/` directory (but missing `pnr_flow/nv_flow/` subdirectory)
     * ❌ Missing: `pnr_flow/nv_flow/` (PnR not run locally - results were imported)
   - **Detection Logic**:
     * If `pnr_flow/nv_flow/` missing AND `export/export_innovus/` contains PnR artifacts (.def.gz, .gv.gz)
     * If `signoff_flow/` exists → Classify as "ECO/Signoff workarea (imported PnR)"
     * Otherwise → Classify as "PnR-imported workarea"
   - **PnR Section Behavior**:
     * Reports "ECO/Signoff workarea detected"
     * Shows available PnR data from `export/export_innovus/`
     * Focuses on signoff/ECO analysis rather than flow execution
     * Avoids misleading "No PnR data found" messages
   - **Use Case**: Common when users want to make incremental changes (timing fixes, ECOs) without re-running full synthesis/PnR
   - **Validation Message**: "ECO/Signoff workarea (imported PnR) detected"

3. Runtime Analysis:
   - **CRITICAL: NEVER use "CPU Time" as runtime** - CPU time is the sum of CPU cycles, not wall-clock time
   - **ALWAYS use "Elapsed time" or wall-clock time" for runtime calculations
   - Example: "Elapsed time for this session: X.XX hours" is the correct metric
   - Extract DC runtime from synthesis logs (including fast_dc if present)
   - Extract PnR runtime from Innovus logs
   - Extract GL check runtime from signoff_flow/gl-check/ directory
   - Extract PV flow runtime from pv_flow status files (include running steps' elapsed time)
   - Extract Auto PT Fix from "Elapsed time for this session" in auto_pt_fix.log
   - Highlight the PnR stage with highest runtime in HTML reports
   - Always extract and display start/end timestamps for all stages
   - Detect fast_dc and adjust PnR start time to setup step (not BEGIN)
   - For running flows: show "RUNNING" status with start timestamp and elapsed time

2. Synthesis Analysis:
   - Extract DC (Design Compiler) version from dc.log and display it
   - Parse QoR reports for design metrics
   - Extract BeFlow configuration variables
   - Display Scenario Summary as formatted tables
   - List Timing Path Groups in single line format
   - Extract floorplan dimensions from DEF files:
     * Parse DIEAREA top-right coordinates (x2, y2) from `flp/*_fp.def.gz`
     * Calculate X, Y dimensions in um: x2/2000, y2/2000
     * Display ONLY Die dimensions: "Die (X,Y): W um x H um"
     * Design Area is extracted but not displayed (redundant with die dimensions)
     * Use ASCII-only characters (um, not μm) to ensure Unix shell compatibility

3. Formal Verification Analysis:
   - **CRITICAL PURPOSE**: Timestamps help catch when designers run ECO fixes but forget to re-run formal
   - Always display start/end timestamps for each formal flow
   - Calculate start time from: end_time - elapsed_time (from log)
   - Use file modification time as end timestamp
   - Show status: SUCCEEDED / FAILED / RUNNING / UNRESOLVED
   - Display runtime in hours
   - **Compare formal timestamps with design changes** to verify formal was re-run after modifications:
     * Check 1: Auto PT Fix log (signoff_flow/auto_pt/log/auto_pt_fix.log) - automatic ECO fixes
     * Check 2: Latest netlist (export/export_innovus/$b.ipo*.lvs.gv.gz) - manual ECOs or any regeneration
     * Warn if ANY design change occurred after formal verification
   - Example issue: Netlist updated 10/08 14:01, but formal ended 10/08 13:31 → formal is stale!

4. Configuration Extraction:
   - Extract runset.tcl variables without truncation
   - Parse beflow_config.yaml for design parameters
   - Handle missing or incomplete data gracefully

## File Management Standards

1. Cleanup unused files:
   - Remove standalone scripts that are no longer used
   - Keep only essential files in the project directory
   - Document removed files in README_ORGANIZATION.md

2. File organization:
   - Main script: `avice_wa_review.py`
   - Launcher script: `avice_wa_review_launcher.csh`
   - Batch testing: `batch_review.py`, `summarize_results.py`
   - Documentation: `README_avice_wa_review.md`, `README_ORGANIZATION.md`
   - Documentation generator: `docs_generator.py`
   - Architecture rules: `architecture.mdc`
   - Cleanup script: `cleanup_test_reports.sh`
   - **Test HTML reports**: `html/` directory (gitignored)
   - **Batch test results**: `batch_review_results/` directory (gitignored)
   - **Presentation materials**: `presentation/` directory (for avice_wa_review demos and training)
   - **AGUR tracking**: `agur_release_tracking/` directory (SEPARATE UTILITY - see below)

3. **Test-generated HTML file management - AUTOMATIC ORGANIZATION**:
   - **✨ NEW: HTML reports are now AUTOMATICALLY organized into `html/` folder**
   - **How it works**:
     * **Direct script runs**: `_organize_html_files()` automatically moves HTMLs after review completes
     * **Batch runs**: `batch_review.py` calls `organize_leftover_htmls()` after EACH unit review
     * **Failsafe**: Even if a review times out or fails, batch_review.py cleans up afterward
     * You'll see: `Organized N HTML file(s) into html/ folder` or `📁 Organized N HTML file(s) into html/ folder`
     * No manual intervention required - keeps project directory clean automatically
   - **Manual organization (if needed)**:
     ```bash
     cd /home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review
     mv *.html html/  # Manual move if needed (rare)
     ```
   - **Cleanup old test reports**:
     * Use `cleanup_test_reports.sh` periodically to clean old test reports from `html/` folder
     * Default cleanup: files older than 1 day
     * Custom cleanup: `./cleanup_test_reports.sh N` (N = days to keep)
   - **Important distinctions**:
     * User-generated reports: Saved in user's own working directory (correct behavior)
     * Developer test reports: Automatically moved to `html/` folder
     * The `html/` directory is gitignored to prevent tracking test artifacts
     * This keeps the project directory clean and repository organized

## Utility Separation and Architecture

### CRITICAL: Two Independent Utilities

This project repository contains TWO SEPARATE, INDEPENDENT utilities:

1. **avice_wa_review** (Primary Workarea Analysis Tool)
   - **Purpose**: Analyze a SINGLE workarea and extract comprehensive metrics
   - **Location**: Root directory (`/home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review/`)
   - **Usage**: `/home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review_launcher.csh <workarea>`
   - **Standalone**: Works completely independently
   - **Output**: Terminal reports + HTML reports for one workarea

2. **AGUR_RELEASE_TRACKING** (Regression Testing Framework)
   - **Purpose**: Track AGUR releases and run BATCH regression testing on multiple units
   - **Location**: `agur_release_tracking/` subdirectory
   - **Usage**: `./run_agur_regression.sh -t formal -c CPORT`
   - **Standalone**: Works completely independently
   - **Output**: Aggregate dashboards for multiple units + CSV exports

### Architectural Relationship

**AGUR_RELEASE_TRACKING** (regression framework in `agur_release_tracking/`)  
  ↓ calls via subprocess  
**avice_wa_review** (single workarea analyzer in root directory)

### Independence Principles

**CRITICAL RULE: Their development should NOT affect each other**

1. **Separate Development Cycles**
   - Changes to `avice_wa_review` must NOT break `AGUR_RELEASE_TRACKING`
   - Changes to `AGUR_RELEASE_TRACKING` must NOT affect `avice_wa_review`
   - Each utility has its own documentation, tests, and maintenance

2. **AGUR Uses avice_wa_review as a Tool (NOT a Library)**
   - AGUR calls `avice_wa_review_launcher.csh` as an external command
   - AGUR parses terminal output or reads HTML reports
   - AGUR does NOT import avice_wa_review Python modules
   - AGUR does NOT modify avice_wa_review code
   - Communication is via: subprocess calls + file output parsing

3. **Interface Contract**
   - `avice_wa_review` provides a stable command-line interface
   - `avice_wa_review` generates predictable HTML report formats
   - `avice_wa_review` returns consistent exit codes
   - AGUR depends ONLY on these external interfaces, not internal implementation

4. **Testing Isolation**
   - Test `avice_wa_review` on individual workareas
   - Test `AGUR_RELEASE_TRACKING` with multiple units
   - Each utility has its own test suite
   - Breaking changes in one should not cascade to the other

### When to Modify Each Utility

**Modify avice_wa_review when:**
- Adding new workarea analysis features (e.g., new timing metrics)
- Improving HTML report generation for single workareas
- Fixing bugs in metric extraction
- Enhancing terminal output formatting
- Adding new flow stages (synthesis, PnR, PT, etc.)

**Modify AGUR_RELEASE_TRACKING when:**
- Adding new regression types (formal, timing, etc.)
- Improving batch processing logic
- Enhancing dashboard generation
- Adding new chiplet/unit support
- Improving parallel execution
- Changing release metadata extraction

### Key Takeaway

**AGUR_RELEASE_TRACKING is a CONSUMER of avice_wa_review, NOT part of its implementation.**  
(Like `grep` command vs. script that calls grep 100 times)

They are separate tools that happen to live in the same repository for convenience, but they remain architecturally independent.

## Testing and Validation Standards

1. Always test new features on multiple workareas
2. Verify cross-directory execution compatibility
3. Test HTML report generation and link functionality
4. Validate command line argument parsing
5. Check Unix shell compatibility for all output
6. Test both fast_dc and regular DC flows
7. Test workareas with RTL formal verification
8. Test workareas with multiple IPOs

9. **Multi-Unit Testing Methodology - CRITICAL**:
   - **NEVER use find commands on parent directories** to search for workareas
   - **Example of WRONG approach**: `find /home/scratch.roir_vlsi/agur/ccoreb/* -name "*.timing"`
   - **CORRECT approach**: Use the `-u <unit_name>` flag with units from AGUR_UNITS_TABLE.csv
   
   **Interactive Testing (Development/Debugging)**:
   - **When to use**: During feature development, debugging, or targeted analysis
   - **Tool**: Direct `-u` flag with `avice_wa_review.py`
   - **Testing procedure**:
     ```bash
     # Test full analysis on random units
     /home/utils/Python/builds/3.11.9-20250715/bin/python3 avice_wa_review.py -u prt
     /home/utils/Python/builds/3.11.9-20250715/bin/python3 avice_wa_review.py -u ccorea
     /home/utils/Python/builds/3.11.9-20250715/bin/python3 avice_wa_review.py -u fdb
     
     # Test specific sections
     /home/utils/Python/builds/3.11.9-20250715/bin/python3 avice_wa_review.py -u prt -s pt
     /home/utils/Python/builds/3.11.9-20250715/bin/python3 avice_wa_review.py -u ccorea -s formal
     ```
   
   **Batch Testing (Regression/Bulk Analysis)**:
   - **When to use**: After major changes to avice_wa_review.py, regression testing, or bulk analysis
   - **Tool**: `batch_review.py` - automated batch runner with filtering support
   - **Use cases**:
     * **Regression testing**: Verify changes don't break existing functionality across all units
     * **Bulk analysis**: Generate reports for all AGUR units at once
     * **Automated monitoring**: Run nightly/weekly checks on multiple units
     * **CI/CD integration**: Automated testing in continuous integration pipelines
     * **Quick targeted testing**: Filter to specific units/chiplets for development (NEW!)
   - **Basic usage**:
     ```bash
     # Run on all 72 units from AGUR_UNITS_TABLE.csv (default)
     /home/utils/Python/builds/3.11.9-20250715/bin/python3 batch_review.py
     
     # Custom output directory
     /home/utils/Python/builds/3.11.9-20250715/bin/python3 batch_review.py --output-dir my_results/
     
     # Analyze results
     /home/utils/Python/builds/3.11.9-20250715/bin/python3 summarize_results.py
     ```
   - **NEW: Quick & targeted testing filters** (supports both interactive AND batch workflows!):
     ```bash
     # Filter to specific units (great for development!)
     python3 batch_review.py --units prt ccorea dqs
     
     # Filter by chiplet
     python3 batch_review.py --chiplet CPORT
     
     # Random sampling for quick testing (5 random units)
     python3 batch_review.py --random --limit 5
     
     # Test specific chiplet with random sampling
     python3 batch_review.py --chiplet QNS --random --limit 3
     
     # Combine filters: specific units from specific chiplet
     python3 batch_review.py --chiplet HPORT --limit 2
     ```
  - **Key differences from interactive testing**:
    * **Interactive (-u flag)**: Single unit, terminal output, immediate feedback
    * **Batch (batch_review.py)**: Multiple units, structured logs, batch processing
    * **Batch with filters**: Best of both worlds - targeted + automated!
  
  - **🚨 CRITICAL RULE - When to use batch_review.py vs avice_wa_review.py directly**:
    * **Testing 2+ units**: ALWAYS use `batch_review.py --units <unit1> <unit2> ...`
    * **Testing 1 unit**: Use `avice_wa_review.py -u <unit>`
    * **Why this matters**: 
      - Single approval vs multiple approvals (better UX)
      - Structured results in batch_review_results/
      - Automatic HTML organization failsafe
      - Summary statistics provided automatically
    * **Example - WRONG ❌**:
      ```bash
      # Don't do this for multiple units!
      python3 avice_wa_review.py -u unit1
      python3 avice_wa_review.py -u unit2
      python3 avice_wa_review.py -u unit3
      ```
    * **Example - CORRECT ✅**:
      ```bash
      # Do this instead - single command!
      python3 batch_review.py --units unit1 unit2 unit3
      ```
   
   **Why this testing methodology matters**:
   - **The `-u` flag uses the AGUR units database** (agur_release_tracking/AGUR_UNITS_TABLE.csv)
   - **Database contains 72 tracked design units** across 7 chiplets (auto-updated daily)
   - **Each unit has a known, validated workarea path**
   - **Using find commands is WRONG**: slow, unreliable, finds outdated/test workareas
   - **The units database is the authoritative source of truth**
   
   **Best practices when testing new features**:
   - **Development phase**: Use `-u` flag with 2-5 random units from different chiplets
   - **Pre-commit**: Run batch_review.py on subset of critical units
   - **Post-commit**: Full regression with batch_review.py on all units (optional)
   - **Always test sections individually first** using `-s <section>` flag
   
   **Available units** (reference: agur_release_tracking/AGUR_UNITS_TABLE.csv):
   - **CPORT chiplet**: prt, pmux, fdb, fth, lnd (5 units)
   - **HPORT chiplet**: ccorea, ccoreb, ccorec, ccored, ccoree, ccoref (6 units)
   - **HIOPL chiplet**: hiopl, ioplca, ioplcb, ioplcc, ioplcd (5 units)
   - **NDQ chiplet**: clt, cscore, dcmp, fdbm, fdbs, fthm, ftos, fwam, fwas, glc, iopl, ioplm, iopx, ir, lndm, nvrisc, pmuxm, prtm, psca, pscb, pscc, pscd, px, riba, ribs, sma, yu (27 units)
   - **QNS chiplet**: dqaa, dqaci, dqaco, dqai, dqamci, dqamco, dqamdi, dqamdo, dqap, dqavi, dqavo, dqax, dql, dqs, eds, qcorer, tds, tecorel, tecorer (19 units)
   - **TCB chiplet**: alm, bta, eri, hib (4 units)
   - **TOP_YC chiplet**: top_yc_clock, top_yc_gpio, yc_clock_macro, yc_fuse, yc_fuse_macro, yu_mng (6 units)
   
   **Total: 72 units across 7 chiplets**

## Error Handling and Logging

1. Use Color class for consistent terminal output:
   - RED for errors
   - GREEN for success
   - YELLOW for warnings
   - CYAN for headers and important information

2. Provide informative error messages with context
3. Handle file not found errors gracefully
4. Log all operations with appropriate detail level

## Performance Optimization

1. Use efficient regex patterns for log parsing
2. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
3. Generate HTML reports only when needed
4. Use generators for large file processing
5. Minimize memory usage for large log files

## Security Considerations

1. Never write to user directories without permission
2. Validate all input paths
3. Use safe subprocess calls
4. Handle sensitive data appropriately
5. Generate reports in safe locations only

## Python Environment Standards

1. ALWAYS use the specific Python 3.11.9 build for testing and execution:
   - Path: /home/utils/Python/builds/3.11.9-20250715/bin/python3
   - Never use generic 'python3' command
   - This ensures consistent Python version across all environments
   - Use this path in all test commands, documentation examples, and scripts

2. Python version requirements:
   - Minimum: Python 3.6 (for compatibility)
   - Preferred: Python 3.11.9 (for testing and development)
   - Always specify the full path to avoid version conflicts

3. Testing and execution standards:
   - All test commands must use the full Python path
   - Documentation examples must use the full Python path
   - Batch scripts must use the C-shell launcher: `/home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review_launcher.csh`
   - This ensures reproducible results across different systems
   - The launcher handles Python path setup automatically

This .mdc file should be referenced for all development work on the workarea review project to ensure consistency and adherence to established patterns.

## Email Implementation Standards

1. **CRITICAL: ALWAYS use SMTP for email functionality**
   - ✅ CORRECT: Use `smtplib` with `smtp.nvidia.com:25`
   - ❌ WRONG: Unix `mail` command is unreliable and doesn't work consistently
   
2. **Proven SMTP implementation pattern**:
   ```python
   import smtplib
   from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
   from email.mime.text import MIMEText
   
   # Setup
   msg = MIMEMultipart()
   msg['From'] = f"{os.environ.get('USER', 'avice')}@nvidia.com"
   msg['To'] = to_email
   msg['Cc'] = cc_email  # Optional
   msg['Subject'] = subject
   msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
   
   # Send via SMTP
   smtp_server = "smtp.nvidia.com"
   smtp_port = 25
   all_recipients = [to_email, cc_email]  # Include all TO and CC
   
   with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port, timeout=30) as server:
       server.sendmail(msg['From'], all_recipients, msg.as_string())
   ```

3. **Email implementation guidelines**:
   - Use MIMEMultipart for message structure
   - Use MIMEText for plain text body
   - Use MIMEBase for file attachments (Excel, etc.)
   - Always include timeout (30 seconds) in SMTP connection
   - Include both TO and CC recipients in `all_recipients` list for `sendmail()`
   - Handle ImportError separately from general exceptions
   - Print traceback on failure for debugging

4. **Reference implementations** (proven to work):
   - `_send_ipo_comparison_email()` (Line 22555): IPO comparison reports
   - `_send_multi_workarea_email()` (Line 22649): Multi-workarea reports
   - `_send_critical_disk_alert()` (Line 4502): Critical disk usage alerts

5. **Common pitfalls to avoid**:
   - ❌ Don't use Unix `mail` command: `mail -s "subject" user@nvidia.com`
   - ❌ Don't use `echo | mail` shell commands
   - ❌ Don't forget CC recipients in `all_recipients` list
   - ❌ Don't use shell=True for email commands
   - ✅ Always use Python's smtplib module
   - ✅ Always use smtp.nvidia.com:25 (NVIDIA's internal SMTP server)

6. **Testing email functionality**:
   - Test with actual email recipients
   - Verify both TO and CC recipients receive email
   - Check email formatting and headers
   - Verify attachments if included
   - Test error handling with invalid recipients

## Critical Disk Alert Feature

### Overview
Automatically sends email alerts when disk usage reaches critical levels (≥90%) during workarea review.

### Feature Details

**Trigger Condition**:
- Threshold: Disk usage ≥ 90%
- Location: Setup section (beginning of analysis)
- Check: Runs `df -h` on workarea path

**Email Recipients**:
- TO: Workarea owner (extracted from path: `scratch.username_vlsi` → `username@nvidia.com`)
- CC: avice@nvidia.com (tool owner, for monitoring)

**Email Content**:
- Subject: `[CRITICAL] Disk Usage Alert: XX% on /mount/point`
- Body includes:
  * Workarea path and design name
  * Filesystem details (size, used, available, usage %)
  * Recommended cleanup actions (5 specific steps)
  * Risk warnings (flow failures, truncated logs, etc.)
  * Timestamp and contact info

### Implementation

**Methods**:
- `_send_critical_disk_alert()` (Line 4502): Sends email using SMTP (smtp.nvidia.com:25)
- `_check_disk_utilization()` (Line 4608): Calls email alert when usage ≥ 90%

**User Extraction Logic**:
```python
# From workarea path: /home/scratch.username_vlsi/... → username
match = re.search(r'/scratch\.([^/]+?)(?:_vlsi)?/', workarea_path)
# Fallback to $USER environment variable
```

**Terminal Output**:
```
[EMAIL] Critical disk alert sent to username@nvidia.com (CC: avice@nvidia.com)
```

**Error Handling**:
- Graceful failure if email cannot be sent
- Info message displayed to user
- Does not block workarea analysis

### Testing

Test with workarea having ≥90% disk usage:
```bash
/home/utils/Python/builds/3.11.9-20250715/bin/python3 avice_wa_review.py -u pscc -s setup  # 96% usage
/home/utils/Python/builds/3.11.9-20250715/bin/python3 avice_wa_review.py -u dqaci -s setup # 91% usage
```

Verify:
1. ✅ Email received by workarea owner
2. ✅ avice@nvidia.com in CC
3. ✅ Proper email formatting
4. ✅ Accurate disk usage details

### Benefits

1. **Proactive Monitoring**: Alerts users before flow failures
2. **Centralized Visibility**: avice receives all critical alerts for tracking
3. **Actionable Guidance**: Email includes specific cleanup recommendations
4. **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't block analysis if email fails

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Weekly digest of all disk alerts
- Track alert frequency per user
- Integration with dashboard for visualization
- Configurable threshold (default: 90%)
