# Master Dashboard - Comprehensive Testing Plan

## üêõ Bug Fixed

**Issue**: DC card appeared twice  
**Root Cause**: Synthesis summary was incorrectly placed inside `_analyze_beflow_config()` helper method, which is called by both Synthesis AND PnR sections  
**Fix**: Moved summary to the END of `run_synthesis_analysis()` method  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed and committed

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing Strategy

### Testing Objectives
1. Verify master dashboard generates correctly
2. Validate all section cards appear only once
3. Test HTML link functionality (Runtime, PT)
4. Verify status logic (especially PT PASS/WARN/FAIL)
5. Test on multiple workarea types (PnR-only, Syn-only, both)
6. Verify portability (open from different directories)
7. Check responsive design on different screen sizes
8. Validate error handling

## üìã Test Matrix

### Workarea Types to Test
| Type | Description | Expected Sections | Priority |
|------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| **PnR + Syn** | Full flow workarea | All 4 sections | HIGH |
| **PnR-only** | No synthesis | Setup, Runtime, PT | MEDIUM |
| **Syn-only** | No PnR | Setup, Synthesis | LOW |
| **Timing PASS** | Clean timing | PT status = PASS | HIGH |
| **Timing FAIL** | WNS < 0 | PT status = FAIL | HIGH |
| **Timing WARN** | WNS < 0.1 | PT status = WARN | MEDIUM |
| **No PT** | PT not run | PT status = NOT_RUN | MEDIUM |

### Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Full Flow Workarea (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Workarea with PnR + Syn + PT
./avice_wa_review_launcher.csh <full_flow_workarea>
```
**Verify**:
- ‚úÖ Master dashboard generated
- ‚úÖ Exactly 4 section cards (Setup, Runtime, Synthesis, PT)
- ‚úÖ No duplicates
- ‚úÖ Runtime HTML link works
- ‚úÖ PT HTML link works
- ‚úÖ PT status correctly determined
- ‚úÖ Overall health matches section statuses
- ‚úÖ Quick action buttons work

#### Test Case 2: Timing FAIL Scenario (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Workarea with WNS < 0
./avice_wa_review_launcher.csh <failing_timing_workarea>
```
**Verify**:
- ‚úÖ PT status = FAIL (red)
- ‚úÖ Issue listed: "Setup timing violation: WNS = -0.XXX ns"
- ‚úÖ Overall health = FAIL
- ‚úÖ PT card appears in "Attention Required" section
- ‚úÖ Key metrics show negative WNS

#### Test Case 3: Timing PASS Scenario
```bash
# Workarea with WNS > 0.1
./avice_wa_review_launcher.csh <passing_timing_workarea>
```
**Verify**:
- ‚úÖ PT status = PASS (green)
- ‚úÖ No issues listed
- ‚úÖ Overall health accounts for PASS
- ‚úÖ Key metrics show positive WNS

#### Test Case 4: Timing WARN Scenario
```bash
# Workarea with 0 < WNS < 0.1
./avice_wa_review_launcher.csh <marginal_timing_workarea>
```
**Verify**:
- ‚úÖ PT status = WARN (yellow/orange)
- ‚úÖ Issue listed: "Setup timing marginal: WNS = 0.0XX ns"
- ‚úÖ Overall health = WARN

#### Test Case 5: Portability Test
```bash
# Generate dashboard
./avice_wa_review_launcher.csh <workarea>

# Copy HTML to different directory
cp avice_MASTER_dashboard_*.html /tmp/

# Open from different location
cd /tmp
firefox avice_MASTER_dashboard_*.html &
```
**Verify**:
- ‚úÖ Dashboard opens correctly
- ‚úÖ Logo displays (embedded)
- ‚úÖ "View Details" links work (absolute paths)
- ‚úÖ Runtime HTML opens
- ‚úÖ PT HTML opens

#### Test Case 6: Error Handling
```bash
# Invalid workarea
./avice_wa_review_launcher.csh /nonexistent/path

# Workarea with missing sections
./avice_wa_review_launcher.csh <incomplete_workarea>
```
**Verify**:
- ‚úÖ Graceful error messages
- ‚úÖ Dashboard still generates (with available sections)
- ‚úÖ NOT_RUN status for missing sections

    ./avice_wa_review_launcher.csh $workarea
    
    # Check if dashboard was generated
    set dashboard_file = `ls -t avice_MASTER_dashboard_*.html | head -1`
    
    if ("$dashboard_file" != "") then
        echo "[OK] Dashboard generated: $dashboard_file"

        grep -q "Overall Health" $dashboard_file
        if ($status == 0) then
            echo "[OK] Dashboard contains health status"
        else
            echo "[ERROR] Dashboard missing health status"
        endif
        
        # Count section cards
        set section_count = `grep -c "section-card" $dashboard_file`
        echo "[INFO] Section count: $section_count"
        
        # Check for duplicates
        set dc_count = `grep -c "Synthesis (DC)" $dashboard_file`
        if ($dc_count == 1) then
            echo "[OK] No DC duplicates"
        else
            echo "[ERROR] DC appears $dc_count times"
        endif
        
    else
        echo "[ERROR] Dashboard not generated"
    endif
