### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages (IMPORTANT!)

   - **Solution**: Keep practicing manual navigation

### üêõ Known Bugs (Be Transparent!)
1. **Formal status misreporting**

## Demo Plan

### Demo 1: Terminal Output (3 minutes)
```bash
/home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review_launcher.csh $DEMO_WA -s runtime pt formal
```
**Show**: Color-coded output, key metrics extraction, section headers

### Demo 2: HTML Report (2 minutes)
```bash

```
**Show**: Clickable links, tablog integration, detailed tables

### Demo 3: Bug Example (Optional, 1 minute)

## Backup Plans

### If Demo Fails
1. Use backup workarea (pmux instead of prt)
2. Show pre-generated HTML from `html/` folder
3. Continue with slides (content is strong without demo)

### If Running Out of Time
- Skip slides 11-12 (examples)
- Go straight to summary (slide 13)
- Quick Q&A

### If Extra Time
- Show master dashboard
- Discuss AGUR release tracking integration
- More detailed HTML features
- Future roadmap
