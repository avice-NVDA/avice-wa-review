## Slide 8: Known Issues & Limitations (3 min)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DISADVANTAGES - IMPORTANT!

#### 1. **Directory Structure Knowledge Loss**
**The Big Risk**: Designers can become too dependent on the tool and lose familiarity with workarea structure.

**Real Impact**:
- Don't know where to find `gl-check.all.err` manually
- Forget the difference between `signoff_flow/auto_pt/` and `pnr_flow/`
- Can't troubleshoot when tool has bugs

**Recommendation**:
- Use tool for **quick reviews** and **sharing reports**
- Still navigate directories manually for **deep debugging**
- New team members should **learn directory structure first** before using tool

#### 2. **File Location Amnesia**
- Users forget where key files live:
  - PrimeTime reports: `signoff_flow/auto_pt/work_*/reports/`
  - PnR logs: `pnr_flow/nv_flow/prc.status`
  - Synthesis QoR: `syn_flow/dc/latest/results/*.qor`
  - Formal logs: `formal_flow/*/logs/`

**Solution**: Keep a cheat sheet of critical paths!

---

## Slide 9: Known Bugs (2 min)

### üêõ Bug #1: Formal Status Misreporting

**Issue**: Tool shows "SUCCEEDED" but actual status is "INCONCLUSIVE"

**Example**:
```
Tool Output:  [OK] Formal verification SUCCEEDED
Real Status:  INCONCLUSIVE - need to check manually
```

**Root Cause**: Parsing logic checks for absence of "FAILED" keyword, not actual success indicators

**Workaround**: 
- Always **manually verify formal status** in critical releases
- Check formal log directly: `formal_flow/*/logs/*.log`
- Look for "All points proven" (real success)

**Status**: Fix in progress - will improve formal log parsing

### üêõ Bug #2: Occasional Path Resolution Issues
- Some relative paths in HTML may break if workarea is moved
- **Fix**: Use absolute paths in HTML reports (partially implemented)

---

## Slide 10: Best Practices (2 min)

### ‚úÖ Recommended Workflow

1. **Initial Check** - Use tool for quick status
   ```bash
   /home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review_launcher.csh $workarea -s runtime pt formal pv
   ```

2. **Deep Dive** - Navigate directories manually for debugging
   ```bash
   cd signoff_flow/auto_pt/work_*/
   cat *.log
   ```

3. **Sharing Results** - Generate HTML report
   ```bash
   /home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review_launcher.csh $workarea
   # Share the HTML with team
   ```

4. **Critical Releases** - Always verify formal manually
   ```bash
   cd formal_flow/*/logs/
   grep -i "inconclusive\|proven\|failed" *.log
   ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è When NOT to Use
- **Deep debugging sessions** - use manual navigation
- **Learning a new design** - explore directories first
- **Critical formal verification** - always double-check logs

---

## Slide 11: Real-World Examples (2 min)

### Example 1: Quick Status Check Before Release
```bash
# Check if workarea is ready for block release
/home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review_launcher.csh $workarea \
  -s formal pt pv gl-check

# Look for:
# - Formal: SUCCEEDED (but verify manually!)
# - PT: WNS/TNS passing
# - PV: LVS/DRC clean
# - GL Check: No errors
```

### Example 2: Debug Long Runtime
```bash
# Check which PnR stage is taking longest
/home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review_launcher.csh $workarea -s runtime

# Output shows:
# - Total runtime: 45.2 hours
# - Longest stage: postroute (12.3 hours) <- Investigate this!
```

### Example 3: Compare Two Workareas
```bash
# Generate reports for both
/home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review_launcher.csh $workarea1 -s pt
/home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review_launcher.csh $workarea2 -s pt

# Compare HTML reports side-by-side in browser
```

/home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review_launcher.csh --help | head -50

# Run basic analysis (runtime + PT only for speed)
/home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review_launcher.csh $DEMO_WA -s runtime pt
```

**Talk while running**:
- "Tool extracts runtime breakdown from PRC status"
- "Shows PrimeTime timing results - WNS, TNS, NVP"
- "Color-coded output for quick scanning"

### Demo Step 2: HTML Report (Browser)
```bash
# Open generated HTML
/home/utils/firefox-118.0.1/firefox avice_runtime_report_*.html &
```

**Show in browser**:
1. Click "View in tablog" button ‚Üí copies command
2. Show detailed tables
3. Click on a log file link ‚Üí opens in new tab
4. Scroll to show footer (copyright)

### Demo Step 3: Show Known Bug (Formal)
```bash
# Run formal section
/home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review_launcher.csh $DEMO_WA -s formal

# Then show actual log
cd $DEMO_WA/formal_flow/
ls -la
cat */logs/*.log | grep -i "inconclusive\|proven"
```

**Point out**: "See how tool shows success, but log says inconclusive? This is the bug!"

## TALKING POINTS - Quick Reference

### Opening (Strong Hook)
"How many times have you spent 30 minutes navigating through workarea directories, checking logs, parsing timing reports? Today I'll show you a tool that does all of this in one command."

### Advantages (Emphasize)
- Time savings: "One command replaces 30+ manual checks"
- Comprehensive: "Catches issues you might miss"
- Professional reports: "Share with team, management"

### Disadvantages (Be Honest)
- "**This is important** - don't become dependent on tools"
- "You need to know where files are for debugging"
- "New designers: learn the structure FIRST, tool SECOND"

### Bug Disclosure (Build Trust)
- "I want to be transparent about a known issue"
- "Formal status can show SUCCEEDED when it's INCONCLUSIVE"
- "Always verify formal manually for releases"
- "Fix is in progress"

### Closing (Call to Action)
"Use the tool smartly - for quick checks and reports, but keep your manual skills sharp. Questions?"
