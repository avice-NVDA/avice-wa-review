        - Use arrow keys to navigate
        - Should see 13 slides total
        - Takes 5 minutes to review

STEP 2: Test your demo commands (paste these):
        cd /home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review
        export DEMO_WA="/home/scratch.ykatzav_vlsi/agur/prt/prt_rbv_2025_09_03_agur_condb_int3_2025_08_27_0_1NL_snap"

        - PRESENTATION_QUICK_REF.txt

================================================================================
PRESENTATION STRUCTURE (25 minutes)
================================================================================

Part 1: Introduction (5 min)
- Problem: Manual checking is time-consuming
- Solution: One command = complete analysis

Part 2: Demo (8 min)
- Show basic usage
- Terminal output
- HTML reports

Part 3: Critical Discussion (7 min) [IMPORTANT!]
- Advantages: Time savings, comprehensive
- Disadvantages: Users lose directory structure knowledge ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Known bugs: Formal status misreporting üêõ

Part 4: Best Practices (5 min)
- When to use tool
- When NOT to use tool
- Recommended workflow

================================================================================
KEY POINTS TO EMPHASIZE
================================================================================

‚úÖ ADVANTAGES:
   - One command replaces 30+ manual checks
   - Professional HTML reports
   - Easy to use - no installation

‚ö†Ô∏è DISADVANTAGES (CRITICAL TO DISCUSS):
   - Users can lose connection to workarea directory structure
   - Forget file locations (gl-check.all.err, PT reports, etc.)
   - Can't troubleshoot without the tool
   - **Solution: Learn structure FIRST, tool SECOND**

üêõ KNOWN BUG (BE TRANSPARENT):
   - Formal status shows "SUCCEEDED" when actually "INCONCLUSIVE"
   - **Workaround: Always verify formal manually**
   - Fix in progress (1-2 weeks)

üìå BEST PRACTICE:
   - Tool for quick checks: YES
   - Tool for deep debugging: NO
   - Tool for formal verification: ALWAYS double-check!

================================================================================
DEMO COMMANDS (Ready to Copy-Paste)
================================================================================

# Setup
cd /home/avice/scripts/avice_wa_review
export DEMO_WA="/home/scratch.ykatzav_vlsi/agur/prt/prt_rbv_2025_09_03_agur_condb_int3_2025_08_27_0_1NL_snap"

If demo fails completely:
- Show pre-generated HTML from html/ folder
- Continue with slides (content is strong)
- Focus on advantages/disadvantages discussion

================================================================================

 Use it for quick checks, but keep practicing manual navigation.
 There's a known formal bug - always verify manually."

This honesty will:
‚úì Build trust with the team
‚úì Set realistic expectations
‚úì Encourage responsible usage
‚úì Make them MORE likely to use the tool (because they trust you)

================================================================================
