## 🎯 Intelligent Status Logic

### Currently Implemented:
- **PT Timing**:
  - FAIL if Setup WNS < 0 (timing violation)
  - WARN if Setup WNS < 0.1 (marginal timing)
  - FAIL if Hold WNS < 0 (hold violation)
  - PASS otherwise

### Future Enhancements (Optional):
- **PV**: FAIL if DRC/LVS violations
- **GL Check**: FAIL if non-waived errors > 0
- **PnR**: WARN if utilization > 80%, FAIL if DRC errors
- **ECO**: WARN if ECO loops > threshold
- **Star**: FAIL if opens/shorts > 0
