# Master Dashboard - Test Results (Round 1)

## 📋 Test Date: October 9, 2025
**Tester**: Sir avice  
**Branch**: `feature/master-dashboard`  
**Commit**: `dc2a911`

---

## 🧪 Test Execution

**Test Type**: Quick validation on single workarea  
**Method**: User ran analysis and reviewed master dashboard HTML

---

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: PnR Card Missing ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: PnR section card not appearing in master dashboard  
**Root Cause**: No section summary added to `run_pnr_analysis()`  
**Fix**: 
- Added `_add_section_summary()` call at end of `run_pnr_analysis()`
- Captures PnR image HTML path and links it in the card
- Shows Design and IPO in key metrics

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - PnR card now displays with link to image HTML

---

### Issue #2: GL-check Card Missing ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: GL-check section card not appearing in master dashboard  
**Root Cause**: No section summary added to `run_gl_check()`  
**Fix**:
- Added `_add_section_summary()` call at end of `run_gl_check()`
- Shows Design in key metrics
- Status set to PASS (can enhance with real status logic later)

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - GL-check card now displays

---

### Issue #3: No Link to Image HTML ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: PnR image debug report HTML not linked from dashboard  
**Root Cause**: `_generate_image_html_report()` didn't return the HTML path  
**Fix**:
- Modified `_generate_image_html_report()` to return absolute HTML path
- Captured path in `run_pnr_analysis()` and passed to section summary
- PnR card now has working "View Details" link to image HTML

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Image HTML link now works

---

### Issue #4: Filename Too Long/Complex ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Master dashboard filename included full workarea path/tag  
**Example**: `avice_MASTER_dashboard_/long/path/to/workarea_tag_v1.0_20251009.html`  
**Root Cause**: Used `os.path.basename(workarea)` which can be long  
**Fix**:
- Changed to use `design_info.top_hier` (design name only)
- New format: `avice_MASTER_dashboard_{design}_{date}.html`
- Example: `avice_MASTER_dashboard_myblock_20251009.html`

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Cleaner, shorter filename

---
