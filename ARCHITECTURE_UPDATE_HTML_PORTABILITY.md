# Architecture Update - HTML Report Portability Standards

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Update Type**: Critical Standard Addition  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Summary

Added comprehensive HTML Report Portability standards to `architecture.mdc` to prevent relative path issues that break HTML links when reports are opened from different locations.

---

## Changes Made to architecture.mdc

### 1. New Section Added: "HTML Report Portability - Absolute Paths Required"

**Location**: Lines 330-376 (Section 6 under "HTML Report Standards")

**Content Added**:
- ✅ Clear requirement: ALWAYS use absolute paths for ALL file links
- ✅ Code examples showing correct vs. incorrect patterns
- ✅ HTML link format examples (absolute vs. relative)
- ✅ Complete list of file types requiring absolute paths
- ✅ Testing protocol for verifying portability
- ✅ Impact statement on portability

### 2. Enhanced: "Cross-Directory Execution Standards"

**Location**: Lines 263-275

**Updates**:
- ✅ Emphasized absolute path requirement in Path handling principles
- ✅ Added cross-reference to HTML Report Portability section
- ✅ Added HTML portability testing requirement

---

## Key Standards Documented

### Path Conversion Requirements

```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Convert to absolute path before storing for HTML
filepath = os.path.abspath(filepath)
html_reports.append(os.path.abspath(html_file))
key_reports.append((name, os.path.abspath(filepath)))

# ✅ CORRECT - Handle paths from external files (e.g., prc.status)
abs_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(self.workarea, path)) if not os.path.isabs(path) else path

# ❌ WRONG - Relative paths break portability
html_reports.append(html_file)  # Could be relative!
```

### HTML Link Format

```html
<!-- ✅ CORRECT - Absolute path works from anywhere -->
<a href="file:///home/scratch.user/workarea/signoff_flow/auto_pt/work_08.10.25_19:02.html">
    work_08.10.25_19:02.html
</a>

<!-- ❌ WRONG - Relative path breaks when HTML opened from different location -->
<a href="file://auto_pt/work_08.10.25_19:02.html">work_08.10.25_19:02.html</a>
```

### Files Requiring Absolute Paths

Documented complete list:
- Work directory HTML files (PT timing summary)
- Log files (GL Check, Runtime, etc.)
- Report files (ClockTree.rpt, cellStats.rpt, etc.)
- Error files (gl-check.all.waived, gl-check.all.err)
- Status files (prc.status)
- Any file referenced via `file://` URL in HTML

### Testing Protocol

Documented standardized testing process:
1. Generate HTML report in workarea directory
2. Copy HTML to user home directory
3. Open HTML and verify all links work
4. Test from different mount points
5. Verify all `file://` URLs open correctly

---

## Rationale

### Problem
Users frequently copy HTML reports to different locations:
- Home directories for local viewing
- Shared team directories
- Different mount points
- Archive locations

Relative paths break in all these scenarios, making reports unusable.

### Solution
**Enforce absolute paths for ALL file links in HTML reports**

This ensures reports are truly portable and work from any location.

---

## Impact

### Before Standards
- ❌ No clear guidance on path handling in HTML
- ❌ Developers might use relative paths unknowingly
- ❌ HTML reports break when copied to different locations
- ❌ Poor user experience

### After Standards
- ✅ Clear, explicit requirement for absolute paths
- ✅ Code examples showing correct implementation
- ✅ Testing protocol to verify compliance
- ✅ HTML reports truly portable
- ✅ Excellent user experience

## Future Compliance

### For New HTML Reports

When creating new HTML report generation functions:

1. **Collect file paths**: Always convert to absolute
   ```python
   filepath = os.path.abspath(filepath)
   ```

2. **Store in data structures**: Use absolute paths
   ```python
   reports.append((name, os.path.abspath(filepath)))
   ```

3. **Generate HTML links**: Use `file://` with absolute paths
   ```html
   <a href="file://{absolute_filepath}">{filename}</a>
   ```

4. **Test portability**: Copy HTML and verify links work

### Code Review Checklist

When reviewing HTML generation code:
- [ ] All `file://` URLs use absolute paths
- [ ] All `os.path.join()` results converted to absolute before HTML generation
- [ ] HTML tested from different directories
- [ ] External file paths handled correctly (relative to workarea)
- [ ] Testing protocol followed

---

## Benefits

1. **User Experience**: HTML reports work from any location
2. **Portability**: Reports can be shared, archived, copied freely
3. **Reliability**: No broken links regardless of where HTML is opened
4. **Maintainability**: Clear standards prevent future bugs
5. **Quality**: Professional, production-ready reports

---

## Conclusion

The architecture now clearly documents that:

> **HTML reports are truly portable and work from any location for all users**

This critical standard ensures all future HTML generation follows best practices, preventing the relative path issues that were discovered and fixed.
